### [Metropolis (art deco)](https://www.behance.net/gallery/3244285/Metropolis-1920)
Remember that movie that everybody tells you to watch because it is amazing and criticizes capitalism but at the same
time it has  an evil robot that fucks everything up with its robotic sexiness and metal tits making us wonder if we
would get rich if we time travelled just to sell real dolls to rich dudes in 1927 but everyone forgets to say that
the movie is 2h long and so fucking boring most of the time because apparently people back then needed extreme gestures
and expressions to understand a scene? Yes? This font has the same name. And it's free.

### [London](https://www.behance.net/gallery/10091725/London)
Inspired by Bodoni, that was created one gazillion years ago (~1786, you do the math), but mostly used on XVIII italian
books and 1960s periodicals. Now I imagine it's being used on some advertises to look fancy. Also, this font was made
by a brazilian and my barely existent patriotism spoke really loud. $$$free$$$

### [Building](https://www.behance.net/gallery/15876377/BUILDING-Free-Font)
Building is the typographic version of a 1950s husband when he comes home and the dinner isn't ready. Better put some
ice on that, honey. Free for personal use. ($13 for commercial)

### [Fakedes (serif)](https://www.behance.net/gallery/24935473/FAKEDES-Free-Font)
Os and 0s kinda reminds me of a vagina but they displayed the characters in gold over grey, that just good advertising,
man. Majestic af.

### [Firefly](https://www.behance.net/gallery/26529061/FREE-Font-Firefly-2015)
Gonna save this here so I can use on my secret lumbersexual aesthetic tumblr. Jk, but it looks like a font that guys will
use to advertise handmade super manly stuff. Like a beard comb made of polished vegan raccoon ribs. You are going to ask
how this comb can be considered vegan if it uses raccoon bones, but in fact the raccoons were vegan.
Combs can't be vegan, they can't even eat. You silly.

### [Argon](https://www.behance.net/gallery/31448981/Argon-(Free-Font))
First thing I thought was the movie Chicago and Catherine Zeta-Jones but looking closely this font is kinda like a
labyrinth so you can print and teach your useless kid how to write.

### [dafont Retro fonts](http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=115&text=Ways+of+Life&fpp=100)
I am way too lazy to categorize them so, yeah. A bunch of fonts. Have fun.

### [GoOgLe](https://fonts.google.com/)
G00gle has all the things.
