# Color palettes
Turn your cyberspace into a magical fountain of color, pleasant a e s t h e t i c s and depressive glittery gifs.

### [ColorLisa](http://colorlisa.com/)
Bypass your colorblindness and lack of style with color palettes of famous painters. Really famous people, like that guy
that cut his ear off and stuff and that other one that hid the holy grail but Tom Hanks found it already, I guess.

### [COLOURlovers](http://www.colourlovers.com/palettes)
"Explore over a million color palettes"
@Seahorsegirl created a gazillion palettes of pink/blue pastel, puuurfect for my seapunk vaportrap mixtape cover.

### [Google, duuuuh](https://material.google.com/style/color.html#color-color-schemes)
They know their shit, unlike me. *sob*

### [Material Palette](https://www.materialpalette.com/)
You choose 2 colors, they choose the rest.

### [Colordrop](http://apoorvsaxena.github.io/colordrop/)
Not generating a palette per se, but awesome for lazy fucks such as myself. You just drag the color to the whatever
thing on your page and [*walla*](http://imgur.com/nXYrLM2).

### [ColorFavs](http://www.colorfavs.com/colors/)
You click on the color, you get a palette. Seriously, you can't get it easier than that. I mean, maybe you can, idk.

### [MaterialUI](https://www.materialui.co/socialcolors)
Steal the colors of your favorites social medias.

### [Skala Color](https://bjango.com/mac/skalacolor/)
Color picker for macOS which is great because I don't have a mac.

### [brandcolors](https://brandcolors.net/)
Steal the colors of your favorites webcyberpages. Why? idk. Maybe to be a kick-ass color stealing crime lord.

### [Flat UI Color Picker](http://www.flatuicolorpicker.com/)
They have a shade of green called Gossip. I love meaningless names for colors. If you are reading this and needs someone
to name colors for you, hire me. I need a job.

### [iOS7 colors](http://ios7colors.com/)
Get the gradient colors that all cool kids adore and that will make Steve Jobs' ghost appear in front of you to shake
your hand with his ghost hands only to realize he can't actually shake your hand because he is a ghost but he will nod
and smile and say 'Great Jobs!' and give you a ghostly magical turtle neck black vest and you will wear it with pride.

### [Colourco](http://www.colourco.de/)
If you move your cursor you get this psychodelic vibe that will remind you of those cool raves you never been to because
your mom didn't allow you to go. It's pretty neat though.

### [Color Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/)
I think @Seahorsegirl must have used this to create palettes. It is really cool. I think it's the best one so far.

### [Coleure](https://www.coleure.com/)
It sounds like cholera and nothing can top adobe's color wheel at this point.

### [LOL colors](http://www.lolcolors.com/)
Make your project laughable with the help of a colored-tears crying emoji.

### [colorhunt](http://www.colorhunt.co/)
It's not exactly a hunt if you just have to choose one, is it?
